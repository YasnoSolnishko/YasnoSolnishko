### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
  
   I am a Junior Data Analyst (former Process Engineer) passionate about data analysis and machine learning. I have always been interested in automating reports and creating sophisticated formulas in Excel to help businesses make the best decisions for their development.   
   To deepen my knowledge in analysis, I have completed several online courses, through which I have learned Python, SQL, mathematical statistics, probability theory, product metrics, and frameworks for product development. Through academic projects, I have gained practical experience in conducting statistical tests, creating dashboards in Tableau, and using Git and Airflow.  
   I am now looking to use my skill set to help another organization improve its decision-making processes through data analysis. I am particularly interested in machine learning and am committed to continuing to learn more about it in the future to become a data scientist.

- ðŸŒ± Currently, I am **looking a job** and learning machine learning. My dream job is one where I can utilize my experience as a Process Engineer and my programming and visualization skills as a Data Analyst.

- âš¡ Recently, I completed a personal project on the Tbilisi secondary real estate market, description can be found by the **[link](https://github.com/YasnoSolnishko/korter.ge-secondary-RE-market)**
